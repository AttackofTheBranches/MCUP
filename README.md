# MCUP: A Hackintosh Updaters

Started a pull script and now I'm here!

Hopefully, one day, an all-in-one hackintosh creation kit.

## What does MCUP mean?

I don’t know. I wrote the early alpha for this a year ago, and then for the longest time I never updated it. Now I’m back and I’ve forgotten. So it stands for Magic Carp Unicycle Parade.

## Requirements

1. A Hackintosh
2. git

## How to Install

```
git clone https://github.com/AttackofTheBranches/MCUP.git

cd MCUP.git

chmod -R +x *

sudo ./Installer.sh

```
