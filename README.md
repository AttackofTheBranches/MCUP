# MCUP: A Hackintosh Updaters

So BASIC it sill uses floppies

A collection of updaters for use with hackintosh laptops.
We'll be gone in a week. I can already hear the lawsuits.

## What does MCUP mean?

I don’t know. I wrote the early alpha for this a year ago, and then for the longest time I never updated it. Now I’m back and I’ve forgotten. So it stands for Magic Carp Unicycle Parade.

## Requirements

1. A Hackintosh
2. git

## How to Install

```
git clone https://github.com/AttackofTheBranches/MCUP.git

cd MCUP.git

chmod -R +x *
